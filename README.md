### The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet:

#### High Fat: 
Because you are going to limit carbohydrate intake, you need to get your energy from somewhere. And in this diet, you get energy from fat. Now, Understand that you can still gain weight on a ketogenic diet if you eat more than you need. You should not eat "unlimited" fat, because if you are overweight, you already have the "high fat" in your body. One common misconception is that you need to eat lots of fat to enter ketosis. This is an oversimplification and not really true.


#### LCHF Pro-Tip: 
If your body is already High Fat, then all you need is the Low Carb


#### Adequate Protein: 
Protein is THE MOST important macronutrient in your body. It is not only to build muscles. All the cells in your body are made up of protein: muscles, bones, organs, even hormones. Protein degrades daily, so you need an adequate amount to repair and build, plus even a little extra if you want to build muscle. Protein intake is mostly lean mass and context dependant, so remember that while 90g may be adequate for someone with a little lean mass, it may be a bit low for someone who has more muscle or is taller.


#### Low Carb: 
Because you enter and maintain a ketogenic state when you stop ingesting carbohydrates. If you eat past a certain amount of carbs, your body switches to burning carbohydrates instead of fats.


A ketogenic diet has a lot of health advantages compared to the standard western diet. Most people do keto because of the weight loss, but it also has other health advantages like lowering risk for heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, and more.
